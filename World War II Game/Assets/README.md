============================================================================= DEVELOPER PROJECT MANAGEMENT POLICIES =============================================================================
I. When writing a script, you must use namespaces. Studio prefered namespace policy recommends "Username.ScriptGroupName".
II. When organizing the files within the project follow these guidelines:
	A. All Models must be placed in the "Models" folder, then all it's components such as, materials and textures. Must be within a container folder called of what the object is.
	B. Standalone Prefabs must be in the "Prefabs" folder. So, if the prefab is a combination of scripts or simple objects without models. This would be considered a "Standalone Prefab".
	C. All Sounds/Music will be placed within the "Audio" Folder. If you have a Sound Effect place it within the "SFX" that is in the "Audio" folder.
	D. All Scripts must be within the Scripts folder.
	E. All Scenes, maps, and etc. Must be within the "Scenes" Folder.
	F. All Scriptable Objects must be within the "Scriptable" Folder.
