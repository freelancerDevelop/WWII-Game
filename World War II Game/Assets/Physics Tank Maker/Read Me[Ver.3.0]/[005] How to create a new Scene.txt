*** How to create a new Scene ***
(1) Set the required components in the scene.
In this project, the minimum required components for the new scene are as follows.

Ground object
The tank in this project requires any collider in the ground.

Navigation Mesh (Nav Mesh)
When you use the AI tank in this project, you need to bake the Nav Mesh for the ground.

"Game_Controller" object.
When you need the following functions, set the "Game_Controller" object in the scene.
You can find the prefab in the "Scene_Components" folder under the "Prefabs" folder.
The "Game_Controller" has the following scripts and the functions.

"Game_Controller_CS (Script)"
This script has some general functions such as Quit, Pause and switching the cursor state.

"ID_Manager_CS (Script)"
This script gives a proper ID number to each tank in the scene.
Also the player can switch the tank in the runtime by this script.

"Input_Type_Manager_CS (Script)"
You can change the operation type of all the tanks in the scene from this script.
Also this script shows or hides the cursor according to the operation type at the opening of the scene.

"AI_Headquaters_CS (Script)"
This script chooses the target of each AI tank in the scene, and gives the target information to each AI tank.
AI tanks never attack any tank without this script.



(2) Set the optional components in the scene.
The following components are not necessarily essential.
However put them into the scene except when you will modify this project.
You can find the prefabs of them in the "Scene_Components" folder under the "Prefabs" folder.

"Canvas_Reticle"
This object has some images used as a reticle screen of the tank gun displayed while aiming.

"Canvas_Markers"
This object contains images for "Position Marker", "Aiming Marker" and "Reloading Circle".

"Canvas_States"
This object has several Text objects used for displaying the state of AI tanks in the scene.

"Canvas_Message"
This object contains some Text objects for displaying the message from the events.
About the event, please read How to use "Event Controller".

You can see the blue bars at the lower left of the screen in the demo scenes.
