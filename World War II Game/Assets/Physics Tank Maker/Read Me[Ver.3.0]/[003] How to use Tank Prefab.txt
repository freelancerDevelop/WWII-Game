*** How to use Tank Prefab ***
(1) Find the tank prefabs.
The tank prefabs are placed under the "Prefab_Tanks" folder.

There are several types of tanks in the folder.

"###_ST"
The tanks named as "###_ST" are optimized for being used in the battle scenes as the player's tank.

"###_AI"
The tanks in the "AI" folder have AI components, and are optimized for being used in the battle scenes as a NPC tank.

"###_AI_ScrollTrack" 
The tanks in the "AI_ScrollTrack" folder also have AI components, and are more optimized for the battle scenes by simplifying the tracks.

"###_PT"
The tanks in the "PhysicsTrack" folder have realistic tracks simulated by the physics engine, but are not suitable for the battle scenes because of the performance.
Usually they are used for creating a new tank with "Static_Track" as the base.

"###_HQ"
The tanks in the "HQ" folder have realistic tracks created for experimental purposes.
You can try them in the demo scene "HighQualityPhysics_Scene".

(2) Drag and drop the prefab into the Hierarchy window.



(3) Choose the "Tank ID" and "Relationship" in the Inspector window.
Select the top object of the tank in the Hierarchy window, and find the "ID_Settings_CS (Script)" in the Inspector window.


At first, set the "Tank ID" differing from other tanks in the scene.
When this value is set to zero, the tank cannot be selected in the runtime.
(Note.)
At least one of the tanks in the scene must be set to "1", otherwise the scene will lose the main camera in the runtime.

Next, set the "Relationship" with other tanks in the scene.


(4) Adjust the position as you will.
Make sure that the top object of the tank is selected, and move the position and the rotation as you will.



(5) Now you are ready to play.
About the settings of AI tanks, please read 'How to use AI Tank'.
