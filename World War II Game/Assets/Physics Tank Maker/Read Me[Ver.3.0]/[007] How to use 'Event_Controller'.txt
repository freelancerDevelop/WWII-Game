*** Outline ***
In the demo scenes, all the tanks are spawned in the runtime by "Event_Controller_CS" script in each object.
Also the messages, the reinforcements and the artillery fire in the scenes are controlled by this script.


The event script has three kinds of Triggers.

"Timer"
When the specified time passes, the event is executed.

"Destroy"
When the specified tank(s) is destroyed, the event is executed.

"Trigger Collider"
When the specified tank(s) touches the specified "Trigger_Collider(s)", the event is executed.
"Trigger_Collider" is a special object used for detecting the contact of a tank, and sending the information of the detected tank to the event scripts.
You can find this object as a long thin translucent box in the demo scenes.


And the event script is able to generate six kinds of Events.

"Spawn Tank"
Spawn the tank with specified settings.

"Show Message"
Show message in the specified Text object.

"Change AI settings"
Change the settings of the specified AI tank(s).

"Remove Tank"
Remove the specified tank(s) from the scene.

"Artillery Fire"
Bombard the specified target.
This event requires "Artillery" object in the scene.
"Artillery" object has "Artillery_Fire_CS" script in it, and we can adjust the settings such as the attack points and the explosion force from the script.

You can find the prefab in the "Scene_Components" folder under the "Prefabs" folder.

"Destroy Tank"
Destroy the specified tank.
Also the event script is able to remove or enable other event scripts with the event.



*** How to set the Triggers ***
At first, choose the "Trigger Type", and set the following settings.


(Note.)
The triggers are sleeping while the event script is disabled, and they awake when the event script is enabled.
In the demo scenes, some of the event scripts are disabled from the beginning, and they are enabled by other event scripts in the runtime.
