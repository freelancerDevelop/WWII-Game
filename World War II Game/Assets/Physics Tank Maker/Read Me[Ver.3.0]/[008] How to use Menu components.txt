*** Outline ***
The demo scene opened before the battle scene is called "Menu Scene" in this project.


In the menu scene, there are several objects used only for menu scenes.




*** How to use Menu components ***
"Menu_Camera"
This object is used as the main camera in the menu scene.
You can adjust the position and the rotation as you will.
The initial viewport size can be changed by adjusting "Size" value in the "Camera" component.


The rotation and the zooming functions are controlled by "Menu_Camera_CS" script in it.


"Menu_Dictionary"
This object is used for sending the list of chosen tanks in the dropdowns and the list of values in the sliders to the battle scene.
The lists are created and sent by "Menu_Dictionary_CS" script in it.

Please input the name of the ballte scene opened from this menu scene into the "Battle Scene Name".
(Note.)
If the "Battle Scene Name" is wrong, the values of the lists will not be reflected in the battle scene.


"Canvas_Briefing"
The Text object used for displaying the briefing of the mission is placed under this Canvas.
The scrolling function is controlled by "Menu_Briefing_CS" script in the Text object.



"Canvas_Button"
The Buttons used for opening other scene are placed under this Canvas.
Please input the name of the scene opened by this Button into the "Scene Name".


(Note.)
You need to add the scene into the "Scenes In Build" in the "Build Settings" to open the scene via Buttons.



"EventSystem"
This object is required to use GUI components such as Button and Dropdown in the scene.


"Canvas_Slider"
The Sliders used for adjusting the "Attack_Multiplier" and "Defence Multiplier" of the player's tank are placed under this Canvas.
You can change their initial values in the "Menu_Slider_CS" script in them.


(Note.)
This script corresponds to the 'Spawn Tank' event with the same "Key Name" in the battle scene.
About the 'Spawn Tank' event, please read 'How to use "Event_Controller"'.


"Canvas_Dropdown"
The Dropdowns used for selecting each tank are placed under this Canvas.
You can change their values in the "Menu_Dropdown_CS" script in them.


(Note.)
This script corresponds to the 'Spawn Tank' event with the same "Key Name" in the battle scene.
About the 'Spawn Tank' event, please read 'How to use "Event_Controller"'.

The symbol objects for the tanks in the scene are placed under this object.
Move, rotate, scale, duplicate and remove them fitting for the battle scene.
