*** How to Start ***
(1) Create a new project, and import this package from Asset Store.
Window >> AssetStore >> Import this package from the "Download Manager".


(2) Set the "Build Settings".
We need to set the "Build Settings" to play the demo scenes.
Open the "Build Settings" window.
File >> Build Settings...


Find the demo scenes in the "Demo_Scenes" folder.


Drag and drop all the scenes into the "Scenes In Build".



(3) Change the "Color Space" to "Linear".
The demo scenes were created in Linear color space, so their light settings are too bright in Gamma color space.
Please change the color space in the "Player Settings".

Edit >> Project Settings >> Player >> Change the "Color Space" value to "Linear" in the "Other Settings".



(4) Play the demo scenes.
You can find the demo scenes in the "Demo_Scenes" folder.
I recomend you to first play the demo scene "01_Operation_Tutorial".
